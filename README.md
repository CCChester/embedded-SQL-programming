# embedded-SQL-programming
You are to use your accounts and DB2 to implement the BIBsearch system. BIBsearch consists of two application programs with simple command line interfaces.  The require-
ments for the programs are given in the following sections. A specification of the underlying schema for the database is also given and includes a schema diagram that indicates pri-
ary  and  foreign  key  constraints.   Note  that  all  projects  must  use  this  schema.   
Either C  or  C++  must  be  used  together  with  SQL  and  the  static  embedded  SQL  protocol  to implement
BIBsearch.
NOTE: As an aid to reducing the scope of the assignment, you are free to assume that none of the application programs is required to check for possible
errors in input.
